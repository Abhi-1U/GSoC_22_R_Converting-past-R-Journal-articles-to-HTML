# Introduction 
 
This paper will highlight how modern day Shylock would love to use the 
[stats](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stats) for his actuarial and 
money lending interests . The same could be applicable for Antonio for 
managing his risk properly had he analyzed and predicted his ship routes 
and data well. 
 
# Background 
 
I use the stats package a lot for my actuarial and general interest in 
data science. Hence this package is a daily driver for me. The various 
functions such as arima and acf help me in estimation and modelling of 
time series data.

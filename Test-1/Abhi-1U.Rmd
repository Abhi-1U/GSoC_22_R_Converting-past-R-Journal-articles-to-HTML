# Introduction  
This paper will highlight how modern day Shylock would love to use the \CRANpkg{stats} for his actuarial and money lending interests . The same could be applicable for Antonio for managing his risk properly had he analyzed and predicted his ship routes and data well.  

# Background
I use the stats package a lot for my actuarial and general interest in data science. Hence this package is a daily driver for me. The various functions such as arima and acf help me in estimation and modelling of time series data.

# A gallery of stats examples

## 1. The AutoCovariance of the log of AirPassengers data using the acf function.  


```{r }
acf(
    log(AirPassengers)
)
```

## 2. Creating a ARIMA model for Air Passengers  

```{r , eval = knitr::is_html_output(), layout = "l-body-outset"}
(fit <- arima(
    log(AirPassengers),
    c(0,1,1),
    seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1),
                  period=12)
    )
)
```

```{r , eval = knitr::is_latex_output(), layout = "l-body-outset"}
(fit <- arima(
    log(AirPassengers),
    c(0,1,1),
    seasonal=list(order=c(0,1,1),
                  period=12)
    )
)
```

# Summary

We have demonstrated some Stat functions that are available in the package \pkg{stats}.
